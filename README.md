# Browser altenatives to built-in node.js modules

This is used by `browserify` module. Initially these files were in `node-browser-resolve`
but disappeared in v1.0.1 which broke `browserify` dependency. This module is that missing
dependency.

**Would love to get test contributions**

"Forked" from `node-browser-resolve`, originally written by Roman Shtylman (@shtylman).
